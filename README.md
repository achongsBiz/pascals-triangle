# Pascal's Triangle

## Introduction
This application will validate several inputs (2 operands, an operator, and an exponent) from the user and from it:

1. Render Pascal's triangle using an algorithm up to appropriate level based on the exponent.
2. Use an algorithm, and the output of Pascal's triangle to create a binomial expansion, creating a preliminary formula.
3. Simplify the formula.

## Architecture
